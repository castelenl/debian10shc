When I was young, I secretly fell in love with a girl who was in the cardamom age. She wrote her passionate feelings on a piece of paper, folded it into a concentric lock shape that could be kept secret, put it in her trouser pocket, and wanted to give it to her. However, I was embarrassed to send it in the classroom, and waited by the road she had to go home. When I saw her, I didn't dare to pass it. There are many opportunities, but I can't grasp it.
